## What worked well during unit 1?
It was a first time I learned Computer science in my life and every classes were really fresh and fun. I felt that if I can understand how the code or system work, I can enojoy coding since I am genuinely interested in coding and staff. However, If I can't understand what is going on in the class or I don't know how the code is working, I suddenly cannot focus on the work and want to give up the work.

## What did you enjoyed the most during project unit 1?
I enjoyed most of the part in the classes such as quizzes, project, etc. Especially, thinking about how to build the system of project with coding was really fun and I

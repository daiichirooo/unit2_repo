# Unit1 Reflection
## What worked well during unit 1?
It was a first time I learned Computer science in my life and every classes were really fresh and fun. I felt that if I can understand how the code or system work, I can enojoy coding since I am genuinely interested in coding and staff. However, If I can't understand what is going on in the class or I don't know how the code is working, I suddenly cannot focus on the work and want to give up the work. So I learned that asking friends and Dr.Ruben to understand what is going on is really important. In this semester, I feel I was able to enjoy in the most of the classes since I learned understanding is the most important thing and I asked question many time. So that is the thing which worked very well.
## What did not work well?
Since I was not able to understand how to write the repository of project 1, I got the low grade and I am rellay regreting about it. I also could not finish the snakify until section 8. Due to this fact, I sometimes cannot understand how to solve the quizzes that we do in the classes. So I am planning to continue working on snakify by myself.
## What did you enjoyed the most during project unit 1?
I enjoyed most of the part in the classes such as quizzes, project, etc. Especially, thinking about how to build the system of project with coding was really fun and I felt that I want to keep work on these kinds of this.
## What talent have you descovered or practiced during this unit?
I still don't know what kind of talent I have in terms of computer science. However, I will keep work hard to enjoy and to improve my computer science skill.
## What is working well in Computer Science for you?
The fact which is working well in computer science for me is that I was able to enjoy to make a coding and every classes which made a motivation in myself.
## What can Dr.Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
Sometimes, I cannot understand what Dr.Ruben is talking about in the class due to my enlish skill. So it would be helpful if you talk a little bit slowly than usual.
